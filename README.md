## Description
The following application is the back end to a hypothetical e-commerce website. The application contains an e-commerce database that is filled by the seed date using the sequelize package using the models of category, product, product tag, and tag. The routes used in the application allow the user to create, read, update, and delete.categories, products, and tags. This has been demonstrated on the link below to the video using Insomnia.
